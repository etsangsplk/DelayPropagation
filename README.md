# TrafficWaves
Microscopic traffic flow models - Train following model

Select a train from the bunch, click “Hit the Brakes” to slow it down and watch the traffic wave form. The red bars show deceleration levels (braking) and the green, acceleration (speeding up). Mouse over any train to see its velocity and acceleration at any given point during the wave (assuming all the trains are in the same single line).
