# Delay Propagation
Microscopic traffic flow models - Train following model

**Original Model:** https://fotisz.github.io/DelayPropagation/original.html

**Minimal Model:** https://fotisz.github.io/DelayPropagation/minimal.html

Select a train from the bunch, click “Hit the Brakes” to slow it down and watch the traffic wave form. The red bars show deceleration levels (braking) and the green, acceleration (speeding up). Mouse over any train to see its velocity and acceleration at any given point during the wave (assuming all the trains are in the same single line).

Contrary to popular belief, much of the congestion expressed as drops in the public performance measure is NOT because of major impediments, but simply a result of emerging patterns when a lot of trains operate on the same line. The simplest explanation why
