# Delay Propagation
Microscopic traffic flow models - Train following model

**Original Model:** https://fotisz.github.io/DelayPropagation/original.html

**Minimal Model:** https://fotisz.github.io/DelayPropagation/minimal.html

Select a train from the bunch, click “Hit the Brakes” to slow it down and watch the traffic wave form. The red bars show deceleration levels (braking) and the green, acceleration (speeding up). Mouse over any train to see its velocity and acceleration at any given point during the wave (assuming all the trains are in the same single line).

Contrary to popular belief, much of the congestion expressed as drops in the public performance measure is NOT because of major impediments, but simply a result of emerging patterns when a lot of trains operate on the same line. The simplest explanation why

Digital Railway is the proposal for the UK to adopt modern digital signalling and train control within the next 25 years and create credible options to upgrade the railway to next generation technology as it becomes available.

Conventional upgrades to the network are vital. But they can’t deliver the major increase in capacity the UK needs without costing too much, disrupting too much, and taking too long. This capacity can only come from making the infrastructure we already have more productive, which is what proven digital technology does.

By using in-train signalling (called the European Train Control System) and traffic management systems which optimise the speed and movements of trains on the network,  they can be run closer together without supervision.
